\begin{enumerate}
\item Using logical identities and laws, show the logic equivalence of
\begin{enumerate}
\item (5 points) $p\leftrightarrow q$
                        and $(p\land q)\lor(\lnot p\land \lnot q)$
\item (5 points) $p\leftrightarrow q$ and $\lnot p \leftrightarrow \lnot q$
\end{enumerate}


\item (10 points) Prove that if $3n+2$ is even integer then $n$ is even, using
\begin{enumerate}
\item a proof by contraposition.
\item a proof by contradiction.
\end{enumerate}
(Hint: see a similar set of proofs in the book).

\item (5 points) 
Disprove the statement that ``for any integer $x>1$, there are positive 
integers $y, z$, such that $x^2=y^2 + z^2$'', by finding a counterexample.

\item (5 points) 
Given three numbers, prove by cases that at least one pair of them has nonnegative product.

\item (5 points) Prove that $2\cdot 10^{200}+11$ is not a perfect square {\bf OR} $2\cdot 10^{200}+12$ is not a perfect square.
	Is your proof constructive or nonconstructive?


\item (5 points)
Prove by induction that $2^n < n!$, $\forall n \geq 4$, where ! denotes the factorial of the number.
